# MiniMax

To run use the following command:

python minimax.py min/max [-v] [-ab] -range n example.txt




To use range you must use "-range 10" with 10 being the value, since the program will look for the int after range 

Needs a min or max to avoid spitting out an exception asking or max or min without caps

File must also be a txt file 

If any issues with python in command line then use python3 which also works, both worked for me in snappy1 so I did all the tests with the python argument





A sample run will look like:

Input:

python minimax.py max example1.txt

Output:

max(a) chooses a2 for 2
